ABM software simulates smoking behaviour using regular smoking theory, quit attempt theory, quit success theory and relapse theory (STPM).

To run the simulation: python main.py props/model.yaml

model.yaml specifies the setting of the parameters of the ABM. In model.yaml, each line specifies a parameter (left hand side of ":") and its value (right hand side of ":").
